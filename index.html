        <p> This was an assignment I got for applying to a Graphic Design Internship. They had this award-winning deodorant
        for whose advertisement I was to design the graphics. So, the assignment was to make three Google Display Ads and three
        Instagram Ads. I did this and the result is in front of you. All these have been made using Canva. </p>
